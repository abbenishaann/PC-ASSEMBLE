2. **Collaboration and Teamwork:** Working with my peers during the assembly was both challenging and rewarding. It highlighted the importance of effective communication and teamwork. Troubleshooting together created a sense of teamwork among the team members. 

3. **Problem-solving Skills:** The assembly process presented unexpected challenges, such as compatibility issues and cable management. Overcoming these hurdles required quick thinking, problem-solving skills, and effective use of available resources. It was a practical application of troubleshooting in a real-world context. 

4. **Attention to Detail:** Assembling a PC emphasized the significance of attention to detail. Ensuring proper cable connections, seating components correctly, and conducting thorough checks contributed to the overall success of the build.

Suggestion
------------
1.**Documentation:**
 Providing comprehensive documentation with step-by-step instructions, troubleshooting tips, and a list of common issues would be beneficial. Clear documentation can serve as a reference for participants during the assembly and for future learning.

2.**Post-Assembly Discussions:**
   Schedule post-assembly discussions to review the entire process, address questions, and share additional insights. This forum allows participants to consolidate their learning and provides an opportunity for further clarification.
